# ToDoList

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

  * You can run the test suite in `mix test`

## Not done User Stories :(

Sorry, didn't had time to implement everything, there is lots of easy things that I could improve (list order_by created_date desc, tasks order by done, improvement in CSS). And there is a couple of US that I didn't implement too.

### US02 - User's favorite to-do lists - Priority: 4

When I have favorite to-do lists, I want to visit my Favorite Lists page, so I can view the details of
the to-do lists that I liked.

### US07 - Edit user's account - Priority: 4

When I have account, I want to edit my account information, so I can have my contact information
and password up to date.

### US08 - Recover user account - Priority: 4

When I have account and forgot their credentials, I want to recover my account, so I can have access
to my to-do lists again.

### US09 - Favorite to-do list - Priority: 4

When I see a public to-do list that I like, I want to favorite them, so I can easily visit them
later.

### US13 - User's profile page - Priority: 4

When I see a public to-do list, I want to visit the owners page, so I can know more about other to-do lists that user has created.

### US15 - Unfavorite a to-do list - Priority: 4

When I have favorite to-do lists, I want to remove them from my favorite list, so I can keep track
only the lists that stills matter to me.

### US18 - Highlight the current page - Priority: 5

When I'm looking at navigation, I want to see which page I'm visiting, so I can localize myself
when I'm looking at navigation.
